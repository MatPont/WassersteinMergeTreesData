# Wasserstein Merge Trees Data

This repository contains scripts to download and preprocess the ensemble data sets used in the paper "Wasserstein Distances, Geodesics and Barycenters of Merge Trees". 

The preprocessing scripts insert metadata as well as the classification ground truth as "Field Data" in the corresponding VTK files.

`dataAllProcessing.sh` will download and preprocess all the ensemble data sets. There are also scripts to process each ensemble individually.

An archive containing the entire set of curated ensemble data sets generated by the above script can be found there:
