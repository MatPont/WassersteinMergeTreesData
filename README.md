# WassersteinMergeTreesData

This repository contains scripts to download and preprocess data used in "Wasserstein Distances, Geodesics and Barycenters of Merge Trees". 

The preprocessing add metadata and clustering information that are embedded as "field data" in the VTK files.

"dataAllProcessing.sh" will downloads and processes all datasets. There are also scripts to process each dataset individually.

An archive of the already preprocessed data can be found here: TODO.
